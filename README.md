# freeCodeCamp webapp vid (link below)
THIS IS A DEPRECATED PROJECT

This webapp is not pinned for a good reason, this was made from a bad tutorial
Basically, I did stuff because the guy was doing it but I didn't get much of what was happening, and I read the frontend part was basically the same (guy not explaining, just rushing things).

So the backend is done, and I stopped at the testing because I'm drownning in a pool and no one's explaining anything, so it works but Don't ask me why how or any questions on it, I just know the "mapping" thing can specify the url in args for the content you're working on to show up ( ("/api/v1/movies/some imdb id") chanegs the url to "http://localhost:8080/api/v1/movies/*imdb id*")

Also, maybe I'm thinking this because of how bad of a tutorial that was, but I think I'll stay on sql databases for now, I got better to learn (more java, backend, etc)
I didn't see any negative comments so I assumed it was good cause it had also +1mil views, too bad
